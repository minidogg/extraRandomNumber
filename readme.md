Silly website for generating a little more random numbers by sourcing randomness from the camera of the users. With permission of course.
This is probably pointless though because I'm betting most devices already take this kind of data into account AND more when generating random numbers.

This is mostly a frankenstein of pasted together code because this is my first time touching the MediaDevices API.
